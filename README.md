Collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in the Go programming language.

This repository serves as reference to some of my blog articles on https://benbarten.com and for personal education.

## Overview

The repository is divided into different sections which evolved over my jearning journey
of algorithmic problems:
* big o analysis
* data structures
* algorithms
* algorithm patterns

## Getting Started
* Run tests: `make tests`
* Run benchmarks: `make bench`
